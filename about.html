<p>
  Around the age of 15 I when first dipped my toes in the culinary world. I world as a bar tender at a hotel, I used to make and serve drinks. 
  At that time I watched a lot of cooking show on Food-Network, my favorite show at the time was from Emeril Lagasse. 
  The way that he cooks was with a feeling and not by following a recipe. 
  I liked this very much, because you cook by using your taste-buds and not by reading
</p>

<p>
  When I started school, it was a sensory overload. I got to learn so much about produce and cooking. 
  At that time I didn’t have a clue about how it would be to work in a kitchen or everything that is possible to do with food. 
  My first kitchen experience was at Larousse in Curacao as an intern. At that moment it was a Michelline Start Restaurant, which I didn’t know. 
  I spend my days there doing some mis en place and preparing the appetizers. 
  Working at Larrouse wasn’t really a positive experience, the food lacked inspiration and love. 
  There wasn’t much to do, because it as a high priced restaurant not allot of people would go there. 
</p>

<p>
  As I was looking for more challenges and things to do, I got send to Brakeput MeiMei in Curacao for my second intern. 
  There is where I learned what it really meant to be a cook. It was a big restaurant, can sit about 200 guests at a time. 
  The kitchen was made up of a 10 person team. Working here is where I learned how to work under pressure and that having a working routine is very important. 
  After my intern I got hired to work there, I used to go to work after school for about a year
</p>

<p>
  I got my ahha moment when I was working at Intermesszo in Curacao, I was working at head chef there and I had the freedom to do what I liked. 
  They did at the time have their own menu, but I got the chance to come up with new ideas and make my own dishes. The review that I got there were so good, and I liked this very much. 
  I was then and there that I knew what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
  I move to The Netherlands in the 2010 to further my culinary studies and chase the dream of becoming a head chef at a restaurant. After 2 months being in The Netherlands I got my first job at Sluisje in Alkmaar. 
  I liked working there because every day was different. There isn’t a time that I can think of that I did the same thing for days after each other. After a few months I started culinary school, 
  I knew a lot already but the only problems was that I knew all cooking terms in English and now I needed to learn them in French. 
  The most memorable moment of going to school, is when we got to go to France for a wine tour. We got to go different wineries, restaurant and escargot. It was a culinary eye-opening moment for me. 
</p>

<p>
  After a few years, and having to see different colleagues leave, I left Sluisje and landed a De Heren van Sonoy. De Heren van Sonoy I once again got the chance to come up with dishes. 
  While working there I got also to be the Sous-Chef. This was a good experience, I liked that I was about to give direction to other cooks, and also have other cooks to help me achieve the things that I wanted.
</p>

<p>
  A few years later, and some other working experience I ended up a Chefz in Oosterhout where I currently work. At Chefz I currently work as Head-Chef, they had really low expectation because all other previous chefs were underperforming. 
  After 2 months of working there the owner and the customer liked the food that I was making. Then was where I official got the keys from the kitchen. I am now able to run the kitchen as I want to.
</p>

<p class="closing-paragraph">
  Until today I’m not allowed to quit because the owner is very happy with me and the customers loves my cooking.
